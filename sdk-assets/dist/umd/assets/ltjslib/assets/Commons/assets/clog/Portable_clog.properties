# exclusionPrefix lets you ignore logs that start with the provided text. This was originally put in for [TRANSPORT]
# when it meant that full request / response pairs were being logged, but now that we control that with other
# options and have it off by default these are no longer required. They are left in here as examples and in case
# you want to turn them off again.
#
# The 'timestamp' option may be set per log level to override the option set in the [GENERAL] section.
